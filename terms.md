## Acceptance of Terms

By accessing or using Cadence ("the Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the Service.

Continued use of Cadence after any updates to these terms constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.

## Description of Service

Cadence is a free, browser-based personal health logging application. Cadence allows you to:
  - Log daily health entries (symptoms, medications, notes) in your browser
  - View summaries and insights based on your entries
  - Optionally sync your data to a Google Sheet you own

Cadence does not maintain its own database or server-side storage of user health data. All health data is stored locally in your browser or in a Google Sheet you choose to connect.

Cadence is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation of the Service.

## No Medical Advice

Cadence is a personal tracking tool. **It is not a medical device, diagnostic tool, or substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.**

  - Cadence does not interpret, analyze, or evaluate your health data for clinical purposes
  - Cadence does not provide recommendations, alerts, or warnings related to your health
  - Nothing in Cadence should be understood as medical guidance

Cadence is not a HIPAA-covered entity and does not claim HIPAA compliance. Cadence does not collect, store, or transmit Protected Health Information (PHI) as defined under HIPAA. Your health entries are personal notes stored locally in your browser or in a Google Sheet you control and are not part of any medical record system.

Always consult a qualified healthcare provider with questions about a medical condition. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it because of something you logged or observed in Cadence.

## Google Account Responsibility

If you choose to sync your data with Google Sheets, you are responsible for:
  - The security of your Google account, including your password and two-factor authentication settings
  - Managing who has access to your Google Sheet
  - Any activity that occurs through your Google account in connection with Cadence

Cadence accesses your Google Sheet only when you explicitly initiate a sync. Cadence does not store your Google credentials. OAuth tokens are held temporarily in your browser's `sessionStorage` and are never stored on any server. See the [Privacy Policy](privacy.md) for full details on token handling.

If you believe your Google account has been compromised, revoke Cadence's access immediately at [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) and secure your account through Google.

## Data Ownership

**You own your data.** Cadence does not claim any ownership, license, or rights over the data you create, log, or sync.

  - Your browser data belongs to you and stays on your device
  - Your Google Sheet belongs to you and is governed by Google's Terms of Service
  - You may export your data as CSV or PDF at any time
  - You may delete your data at any time through the app or by clearing your browser storage

Cadence does not access, copy, or retain your data beyond what is necessary to provide the Service during an active session.

## Acceptable Use

You agree not to:
  - Use Cadence for any unlawful purpose
  - Attempt to interfere with or disrupt the Service
  - Reverse-engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of Cadence
  - Use automated systems (bots, scrapers) to access the Service
  - Misrepresent your identity or impersonate another person when using Cadence's contact form

## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law:

  - Cadence is provided **without warranty of any kind**, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement
  - The developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of or inability to use the Service
  - The developer shall not be liable for any loss or corruption of data stored in your browser or Google Sheet
  - The developer's total liability for any claim arising from the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid to use the Service (which is zero, as Cadence is free)

You acknowledge that Cadence relies on third-party services (Google APIs, Vercel) and the developer is not responsible for outages, changes, or failures of those services.

## Termination

### Your Right to Stop Using Cadence
You may stop using Cadence at any time. No account exists to delete. To fully disconnect:
  - Clear your browser's localStorage to remove local data
  - Delete or disconnect your Google Sheet if you synced data
  - Revoke Cadence's access at [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)

### Our Right to Restrict Access
We reserve the right to restrict or terminate access to Cadence at any time, for any reason, without notice. This includes the right to discontinue the Service entirely. Since Cadence does not have user accounts, termination in practice means the Service may become unavailable.

Upon termination, your local browser data remains on your device and your Google Sheet remains in your Google Drive. Cadence does not retain or delete any data on your behalf.

## Changes to These Terms

These terms may be updated as Cadence evolves. Significant changes will be reflected by an updated "Last updated" date at the top of this page.

Continued use of Cadence after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.

## Governing Law

These Terms of Service are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, United States of America, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Any disputes arising from these terms or your use of Cadence shall be resolved in the courts located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
